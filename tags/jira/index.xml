      <description>This article is going to be much less technical than the ones I use to write, the goal is to simply provide a basic introduction to Jira and some of it&amp;rsquo;s main capacities. Hopefully in the near future this article will work as the introduction on a Jira manual that my team and myself are writting for my current employeer, I thought before all that manual is finished it might be useful to share this here.</description>
